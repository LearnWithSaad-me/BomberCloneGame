# Bomberman Clone - C++ Game

This is a simplified version of the classic **Bomberman** arcade game, developed using C++. The game features a grid-based environment where the player places bombs to destroy obstacles, defeat enemies, and survive. The game is designed for fun, strategy, and timing.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: The player moves using the arrow keys, and movement is restricted by obstacles and walls.
- **Bomb Placement**: The player can place bombs that detonate after a short delay, clearing destructible obstacles and damaging enemies.
- **Enemies**: Enemies move randomly within the grid, avoiding walls and obstacles.
- **Explosions**: Bomb explosions have a fixed range and affect all entities within the radius.
- **Obstacles**:
  - 'O': Destructible blocks that disappear when hit by an explosion.
  - '#': Indestructible walls that block movement and explosions.
- **Power-ups**: Randomly placed power-ups that can grant the player special abilities like increased speed or bomb range.
- **Win/Loss Conditions**: The player wins by defeating all enemies. The game ends when the player is caught in an explosion or collides with an enemy.
